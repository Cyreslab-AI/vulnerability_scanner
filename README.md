# Advanced Vulnerability Scanner

The Advanced Vulnerability Scanner is a powerful tool designed for integration into DevOps pipelines. It analyzes frameworks and libraries used in codebases for the latest vulnerabilities, providing comprehensive security insights and continuous monitoring capabilities.

## Features

1. **Multi-Ecosystem Support**: Analyzes dependencies for PyPI, npm, RubyGems, and Maven ecosystems.
2. **Continuous Monitoring and Alerting**: Performs scheduled scans and sends email alerts for newly detected vulnerabilities.
3. **Machine Learning for Vulnerability Prediction**: Utilizes a machine learning model to predict potential vulnerabilities.
4. **Interactive CLI**: Provides a visually appealing console output using rich text formatting.
5. **Web-based User Interface**: Offers an easy-to-use web interface for running scans and configuring the tool.
6. **Dependency Graph Analysis**: Generates a visual representation of the project's dependency structure.
7. **Docker Container Scanning**: Scans Docker images for potential vulnerabilities.
8. **License Compliance Checking**: Ensures that package licenses comply with project requirements.
9. **Customizable Vulnerability Severity Thresholds**: Allows setting minimum severity levels for reporting.
10. **Multiple Output Formats**: Generates reports in console, JSON, and HTML formats.
11. **Automatic Dependency File Detection**: Detects the appropriate dependency file and ecosystem automatically.
12. **Plugin Architecture**: Supports custom plugins for extending functionality.
13. **Internationalization Support**: Allows for easy translation to different languages.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/advanced-vulnerability-scanner.git
   cd advanced-vulnerability-scanner
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### CLI Interface

Run the vulnerability scanner with:

```
python -m vulnerability_scanner.advanced_vulnerability_scanner --config config.yaml
```

For automatic dependency file detection, simply run:

```
python -m vulnerability_scanner.advanced_vulnerability_scanner
```

### Web Interface

To start the web interface:

1. Navigate to the `web_ui` directory:
   ```
   cd web_ui
   ```

2. Run the Flask application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

3. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`

## Configuration

Create a `config.yaml` file in the project root with the following structure:

```yaml
dependencies_file: path/to/dependencies.file
ecosystem: PyPI  # or npm, RubyGems, Maven
output_format: html  # or json, text
min_severity: MODERATE  # or LOW, HIGH, CRITICAL
scan_docker: true
continuous_monitoring: false
monitoring_interval: 24  # in hours
allowed_licenses:
  - MIT
  - Apache-2.0
  - BSD
alert_email:
  sender: your_email@example.com
  receiver: alert_receiver@example.com
  password: your_email_password
```

## Development

### Running Tests

To run the test suite:

```
python -m unittest discover tests
```

### Adding Plugins

Create a new Python file in the `plugins` directory. Each plugin should have a `register_plugin()` function that returns an object with `pre_scan` and/or `post_scan` methods.

### Internationalization

To add a new language, create a new `.po` file in the `locales` directory and use the `gettext` tools to compile it.
